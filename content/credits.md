## Theme

This epic UI theme you see right now is a horrendous monstrosity
built from parts of the following GitHub pages themes:

- [Midnight](https://github.com/pages-themes/midnight)
- [Leap Day](https://github.com/pages-themes/leap-day).

I was (am, and will always be) too lazy to reverse-engineer CSS myself so
I used `github-dark` theme from [Pygments](https://pygments.org/).

~~Could have just used the default GitHub dark theme smh.~~
