Personal notes and stuff.
Got nothing better to do basically.

## How to run locally

In case I forget.

Run this to install stuff.

```bash
brew install chruby ruby-install xz
```

Now install ruby version from [`.ruby-version`](./.ruby-version)

```bash
ruby-install ruby 3.1.3
```

Then just install this.

```bash
gem install github-pages
```

Then run this and do what it says.

```bash
jekyll serve
```
